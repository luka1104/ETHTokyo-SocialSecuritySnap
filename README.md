# SocialSecuritySnap

## the project is

MetaMask Snap enhances security through:

1. Lens Protocol integration, displaying contract interactions by followed users to flag potential spam
2. GPT-4 reviewing transaction methods, highlighting risks
3. Worldcoin KYC authentication. Prevent accidental spam contract approvals!

## what it aims to accomplish

- **Lens Protocol Integration for Security Enhancement:**
  Improve security by displaying within MetaMask whether people followed using Lens Protocol have interacted with the smart contract. This will help users identify potential spam contracts.
- **GPT-4 Integration for Security Enhancement:**
  Further enhance security by using GPT-4 to review the purpose and risks of a transaction before execution. Explanations will be displayed within MetaMask to reduce the risk of approving malicious transactions.
- **Worldcoin Authentication for KYC information:**
  Ensure only verified individuals can participate in transactions by requiring proper identification and verification through Worldcoin Authentication.
- **Superfluid Subscription Services:**
  Enhance user experience by offering real-time subscription services with per-second payment granularity using Superfluid.
  The project primarily addresses the issue of transparency and understanding in executing transactions on smart contracts, reducing the likelihood of users approving malicious or spam contracts.
