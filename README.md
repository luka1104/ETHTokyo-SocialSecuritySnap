# SocialSecuritySnapp

## the project is

MetaMask Snap enhances security through: 1) Lens Protocol integration, displaying contract interactions by followed users to flag potential spam 2) GPT-4 reviewing transaction methods, highlighting risks 3) Worldcoin KYC authentication. Prevent accidental spam contract approvals!

## what it aims to accomplish

This project aims to enhance the Ethereum blockchain wallet, called MetaMask Snap, by developing extensions to improve security, user experience, and provide additional services. MetaMask is a browser extension that allows users to easily manage cryptocurrencies and digital assets, as well as perform transactions. The project's primary goals are as follows:

Lens Protocol Integration for Security Enhancement:

By integrating Lens Protocol, the system will display on MetaMask whether people you follow using the protocol have previously interacted with the smart contract.
If no one you follow has ever executed the contract, this could indicate potential spam, helping users make informed decisions.
GPT-4 Integration for Security Enhancement:

Before executing a transaction, the method's purpose and risks will be reviewed using GPT-4, with explanations displayed within MetaMask.
This feature aims to reduce the likelihood of users inadvertently approving malicious contracts or transactions.
Worldcoin Authentication for KYC (Know Your Customer) information:

Users will be unable to access services without proper identification and verification.
This ensures that only verified individuals can participate, enhancing overall security.
Superfluid Subscription Services:

Superfluid enables subscription services with payments at a per-second granularity.
This feature allows users to pay for subscription services in real-time, enhancing the overall experience.
The main issue the project addresses is the lack of transparency and understanding of the transactions being executed on smart contracts. Users may not know or check the details of the transaction, leading to an increased risk of inadvertently approving spam contracts. The integration of Lens Protocol and GPT-4 aims to resolve this issue by improving security measures and providing essential information to users before executing a transaction.

## steps for running locally

This repository demonstrates how to develop a snap with TypeScript. For detailed instructions, see [the MetaMask documentation](https://docs.metamask.io/guide/snaps.html#serving-a-snap-to-your-local-environment).

MetaMask Snaps is a system that allows anyone to safely expand the capabilities of MetaMask. A _snap_ is a program that we run in an isolated environment that can customize the wallet experience.

## Snaps is pre-release software

To interact with (your) Snaps, you will need to install [MetaMask Flask](https://metamask.io/flask/), a canary distribution for developers that provides access to upcoming features.

## Getting Started

Clone the template-snap repository [using this template](https://github.com/MetaMask/template-snap-monorepo/generate) and setup the development environment:

```shell
yarn install && yarn start
```

## Cloning

This repository contains GitHub Actions that you may find useful, see `.github/workflows` and [Releasing & Publishing](https://github.com/MetaMask/template-snap-monorepo/edit/main/README.md#releasing--publishing) below for more information.

If you clone or create this repository outside the MetaMask GitHub organization, you probably want to run `./scripts/cleanup.sh` to remove some files that will not work properly outside the MetaMask GitHub organization.

Note that the `action-publish-release.yml` workflow contains a step that publishes the frontend of this snap (contained in the `public/` directory) to GitHub pages. If you do not want to publish the frontend to GitHub pages, simply remove the step named "Publish to GitHub Pages" in that workflow.

If you don't wish to use any of the existing GitHub actions in this repository, simply delete the `.github/workflows` directory.

## Contributing

### Testing and Linting

Run `yarn test` to run the tests once.

Run `yarn lint` to run the linter, or run `yarn lint:fix` to run the linter and fix any automatically fixable issues.

### Releasing & Publishing

The project follows the same release process as the other libraries in the MetaMask organization. The GitHub Actions [`action-create-release-pr`](https://github.com/MetaMask/action-create-release-pr) and [`action-publish-release`](https://github.com/MetaMask/action-publish-release) are used to automate the release process; see those repositories for more information about how they work.

1. Choose a release version.

- The release version should be chosen according to SemVer. Analyze the changes to see whether they include any breaking changes, new features, or deprecations, then choose the appropriate SemVer version. See [the SemVer specification](https://semver.org/) for more information.

2. If this release is backporting changes onto a previous release, then ensure there is a major version branch for that version (e.g. `1.x` for a `v1` backport release).

- The major version branch should be set to the most recent release with that major version. For example, when backporting a `v1.0.2` release, you'd want to ensure there was a `1.x` branch that was set to the `v1.0.1` tag.

3. Trigger the [`workflow_dispatch`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#workflow_dispatch) event [manually](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/manually-running-a-workflow) for the `Create Release Pull Request` action to create the release PR.

- For a backport release, the base branch should be the major version branch that you ensured existed in step 2. For a normal release, the base branch should be the main branch for that repository (which should be the default value).
- This should trigger the [`action-create-release-pr`](https://github.com/MetaMask/action-create-release-pr) workflow to create the release PR.

4. Update the changelog to move each change entry into the appropriate change category ([See here](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/#types) for the full list of change categories, and the correct ordering), and edit them to be more easily understood by users of the package.

- Generally any changes that don't affect consumers of the package (e.g. lockfile changes or development environment changes) are omitted. Exceptions may be made for changes that might be of interest despite not having an effect upon the published package (e.g. major test improvements, security improvements, improved documentation, etc.).
- Try to explain each change in terms that users of the package would understand (e.g. avoid referencing internal variables/concepts).
- Consolidate related changes into one change entry if it makes it easier to explain.
- Run `yarn auto-changelog validate --rc` to check that the changelog is correctly formatted.

5. Review and QA the release.

- If changes are made to the base branch, the release branch will need to be updated with these changes and review/QA will need to restart again. As such, it's probably best to avoid merging other PRs into the base branch while review is underway.

6. Squash & Merge the release.

- This should trigger the [`action-publish-release`](https://github.com/MetaMask/action-publish-release) workflow to tag the final release commit and publish the release on GitHub.

7. Publish the release on npm.

- Be very careful to use a clean local environment to publish the release, and follow exactly the same steps used during CI.
- Use `npm publish --dry-run` to examine the release contents to ensure the correct files are included. Compare to previous releases if necessary (e.g. using `https://unpkg.com/browse/[package name]@[package version]/`).
- Once you are confident the release contents are correct, publish the release using `npm publish`.

## Notes

- Babel is used for transpiling TypeScript to JavaScript, so when building with the CLI,
  `transpilationMode` must be set to `localOnly` (default) or `localAndDeps`.
